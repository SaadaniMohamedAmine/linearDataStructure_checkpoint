In this repistory,
you will find the answer of two problems given as the checkpoint of chapter "Linear data structure".
The first part is the solution with algorithm structure .
The second one is the solution implemented with javascript syntax.

Here is the statement:
Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set. 
Example:
Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 13 (distinct elements - 4, 7, 2 )
Give two Solution to this problem, using a different type of data structures each time.
Now, given two sets of integers, write also two algorithms to print the sum of overlapping elements in two sets. The elements in each set are unique or there are no duplicates within a set.
Example:
Set 1: [12, 13, 6, 10]
Set 2: [13, 10, 16, 15]
Sum of overlapping elements: 46
Explanation: Common elements are 10, 13
